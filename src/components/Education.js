              I spent my college days at <strong>Kumaraguru College of Technology</strong>, where I enjoyed a unique blend of online learning and on-campus fun. The unforgettable memories I made during my time there, especially with friends, made it a truly special experience, even if the pandemic had us spending a couple of years at home! ðŸŽ“

              My journey began at <strong>Kongu Matric. Hr. Sec School</strong> in Erode, where I honed my skills in dodging homework while still achieving top marks. Those were some wild times filled with sports, friends, and, of course, more homework!

            <p style={{ color: '#333' }}>
              Then, I moved on to <strong>Adharsh Vidhalaya Hr. Sec School</strong> in Anthiyur, Erode. I completed my time there in <em>2019</em>, finally earning my freedom! ðŸ˜„
